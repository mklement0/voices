.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
\fBvoices\fP sets the default voice for OS X's TTS (text\-to\-speech) synthesis or
.br
returns information about the default, active and installed voices\.
.br
Additionally, it can speak either the demo text or specified text with
.br
multiple voices\.
.P
Case doesn't matter when specifying voice or language names\.
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
Specify voice names as they appear in System Preferences >
.br
Dictation & Speeech and in the output from \fBsay \-v \\?\fP\|\.
.IP \(bu 2
Specify languages as two\-character language IDs (e\.g\., \fBen\fP), optionally
.br
followed by \fB_\fP and a region identifier (e\.g\., \fBen_US\fP)\.

.RE
.P
Options \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-L\fP target all \fIactive\fR voices by default, which are
.br
typically a a subset of all \fIinstalled\fR voices, and constitute the set of
.br
voices selected for active use in System Preferences > Dictation & Speech >
.br
Text to Speech\.
.br
Adding \fB\-a\fP targets all installed voices\.
.P
The \fB\-k\fP option for speaking with all targeted voices as well as other
.br
shared options are discussed further below\. Without \fB\-k\fP, only printed output
.br
is produced; conversely, \fB\-q\fP silences printed output\.
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
1st synopsis form: \fB[\-d [<newDefaultVoice>]]\fP, \fB[\-\-default [<newDefaultVoice>]]\fP
.br
Returns information about the default voice or sets a new default voice\.
.br
Note that any installed voice can be specified as the default voice, even
.br
if it is not among the set of active voices\.
.IP \(bu 2
2nd synopsis form: \fB<voice>\.\.\.\fP
.br
Lists information about the specified voices (whether active or not)\.
.IP \(bu 2
3rd synopsis form: \fB\-l [<lang>\.\.\.]\fP, \fB\-\-list [<lang>\.\.\.]\fP
.br
Lists information about active, installed, or voices matching one or more
.br
specified languages\.
.br
Lists all active voices by default; \fB\-a\fP lists all installed ones\.
.br
If at least one \fB<lang>\fP operand is given, the list of active voices (by
.br
default) / installed voices (with \fB\-a\fP) is filtered to output only those
.br
matching the specified language(s)\.
\fB<lang>\fP values may be mere language IDs (e\.g\., \fBen\fP) or language + region
.br
IDs (e\.g\., \fBen_US\fP); e\.g\., \fBen\fP matches all English voices irrespective of
.br
region, whereas \fBen_US\fP matches only US English voices\.
.IP \(bu 2
4th synopsis form: \fB\-L\fP, \fB\-\-list\-langs\fP
.br
Lists the distinct set of languages supported among all active (by default)
.br
or all installed (\fB\-a\fP) voices\.
.br
Languages are listed as language + region identifiers, e\.g\., \fBen_US\fP\|\.
.IP \(bu 2
5th synopsis form:  \fB\-m\fP, \fB\-\-manage\fP
.br
Opens System Preferences > Dictation & Speech, where you can manage the
.br
set of active voices, install additional voices, and control other aspects
.br
of text\-to\-speech synthesis\.

.RE
.SH SHARED OPTIONS
.P
These options complement the main options, which determine the synopsis form,
.br
discussed above\.
.SS General Options
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-q\fP
.br
Quiet mode: suppresses printed output, such as when only speech output
.br
(\fB\-k\fP) is desired or when the new default voice should be set quietly\.
.br
Cannot be combined with \fB\-L\fP, whose sole purpose is to print
.br
information\.

.RE
.SS Speaking options (synopsis forms 1\-3):
.P
Note that if the command targets multiple voices, speaking happens
after each voice's information has been printed (unless printing is
.br
suppressed with \fB\-q\fP)\.
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-k\fP, \fB\-\-speak\fP (no argument)
.br
  Speaks each targeted voice's demo text\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-k"<text>"\fP, \fB\-\-speak="<text>"\fP
.br
  Speaks the specified text using each targeted voice\.
.br
  Note that \fB"<text>"\fP must be directly attached to the option and should
.br
  generally be quoted to protect it from (unwanted) interpretation by the
.br
  shell\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-k\-\fP, \fB\-\-speak=\-\fP
.br
  Speaks text provided via stdin using each targeted voice\.

.RE
.SS Printed\-Output Options (synopsis forms 1\-3)
.P
By default, voice information printed is in the form provided by the standard
.br
\fBsay\fP utility when invoked as \fBsay \-v \\?\fP, which is:
.br
\fB<voice> <lang> # <demo text>\fP
.P
The following, mutually exclusive options modify this behavior:
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-b\fP, \fB\-\-bare\fP
.br
Outputs mere voice names only\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-i\fP, \fB\-\-internals\fP
.br
Outputs internal voice identifiers, as used by the system\.

.RE
.SH STANDARD OPTIONS

All standard options must be provided as the only argument; all of them provide
.br
information only\.
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP
.br
Prints the contents of the synopsis chapter to stdout for quick reference\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-man\fP

.br
if the manual page isn't installed\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-version\fP
.br
Prints version information\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-home\fP
.br
Opens this utility's home page in the system's default web browser\.
